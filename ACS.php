      <div class="navbar2">
        
        <p class="p2">We are a globally distributed organization working on improving equity in digital science education.  As we enter the Anthropocene, a geologic epoch where humans overwhelming impact Earth system processes, it is critically important that we train responsible planetary stewards.  This needs to be done at all levels and educational settings, from the formal classroom to informal learning events.  Digital technologies are some of the most impactful ways of improving science education universally, when done right.  Coupled with game-based learning, role-playing, place-based learning, and other experiential modes of learning, we are working to transform science education to better meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
        <p class="p3">We are currently working on two major projects:  1) Greenworks, a global environmental classroom for role-playing curricula and community impact projects and 2) Agavi, a digital science learning platform for low-resource areas.  We also work on experimental projects in science tourism and talk with science educators via our Global.Science podcast.</p>

    <p class="p2">A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized XML messaging system. XML is used to encode all communications to a web service. For example, a client invokes a web service by sending an XML message, then waits for a corresponding XML response.</p>
    <p class="p3">A service is an "(intangible) act or use for which a consumer, firm, or government is willing to pay." Examples include work done by barbers, doctors, lawyers, mechanics, banks, insurance companies, and so on.</p>
    <p class="p4">A web design service provides you with a customized website design that's perfect for your business or personal site. They'll work with you to create a design that matches your brand, while giving your customers a seamless user experience that will delight them.</p>
