    <p class="p3">Tortoises (/ˈtɔːr.təs.ɪz/) are reptiles of the family Testudinidae of the order Testudines (Latin: tortoise). Like other turtles, tortoises have a shell to protect from predation and other threats. The shell in tortoises is generally hard, and like other members of the suborder Cryptodira, they retract their necks and heads directly backward into the shell to protect them.</p>
    <p class="p4">Tortoises can vary in size with some species, such as the Galápagos giant tortoise, growing to more than 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) in length, whereas others like the Speckled cape tortoise have shells that measure only 6.8 centimetres (2.7 in) long.[1] Several lineages of tortoises have independently evolved very large body sizes in excess of 100 kg, including the Galapagos giant tortoise and the Aldabra giant tortoise.</p>
    <p class="p5">The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses "turtle" to describe all species of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are land-dwelling or sea-dwelling, and uses "tortoise" as a more specific term for slow-moving terrestrial species.[2] General American usage agrees; turtle is often a general term (although some restrict it to aquatic turtles); tortoise is used only in reference to terrestrial turtles or, more narrowly, only those members of Testudinidae, the family of modern land tortoises; and terrapin may refer to turtles that are small and live in fresh and brackish water, in particular the diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin).[4][5][6][7] In America, for example, the members of the genus Terrapene dwell on land, yet are referred to as box turtles rather than tortoises.[3].</p>

    <p class="p2"><b>NAME:</b>Jelly Fish<br><br><b>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</b>Scyphozoa<br><br><b>ORIGIN:</b>America and Antarctica<br><br><b>LIFESPAN:</b>2 to 3 Years</p>
    <p class="p3">Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the immortal jellyfish, is a species of small, biologically immortal jellyfish[2][3] found worldwide in temperate to tropic waters. It is one of the few known cases of animals capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual. Others include the jellyfish Laodicea undulata[4] and species of the genus Aurelia.[5]</p>
    <p class="p4">Theoretically, this process can go on indefinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal,[3][8] although in practice individuals can still die. In nature, most Turritopsis dohrnii are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the medusa stage without reverting to the polyp form.[9]

        The capability of biological immortality with no maximum lifespan makes T. dohrnii an important target of basic biological, aging and pharmaceutical research.[10]</p>
    <p class="p5">Like most other hydrozoans, T. dohrnii begin their life as tiny, free-swimming larvae known as planulae. As a planula settles down, it gives rise to a colony of polyps that are attached to the sea floor. All the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones.[6] The polyps form into an extensively branched form, which is not commonly seen in most jellyfish. Jellyfish, also known as medusae, then bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free-swimming form, eventually becoming sexually mature. When sexually mature, they have been known to prey on other jellyfish species at a rapid pace. If the T. dohrnii jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress, physical assault, or is sick or old, it can revert to the polyp stage, forming a new polyp colony.[7] It does this through the cell development process of transdifferentiation, which alters the differentiated state of the cells and transforms them into new types of cells.</p>

    <p class="p2"><b>NAME:</b>Shark<br><br><b>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</b>Selachimorpha<br><br><b>ORIGIN:</b>Asia and Antarctica<br><br><b>LIFESPAN:</b>20 to 30 Years</p>
    <p class="p3">The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the gurry shark, grey shark, or by the Kalaallisut name eqalussuaq, is a large shark of the family Somniosidae ("sleeper sharks"), closely related to the Pacific and southern sleeper sharks.[2] The distribution of this species is mostly restricted to the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean; however, more recent evidence indicates that at great depths it may range as far south as the Caribbean.</p>
    <p class="p4">The Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrate species (estimated to be between 250 and 500 years),[3] and is among the largest extant species of shark. It is a generalist feeder, consuming a variety of available foods.[4] As an adaptation to living at depth,[5] it has a high concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide in its tissues, which causes the meat to be toxic.[6] Greenland shark flesh, treated to reduce toxin levels, is eaten in Iceland as a delicacy known as kæstur hákarl.[7] </p>
    <p class="p5">The Greenland shark is one of the largest living species of shark. It usually grows between 2.4–4.3 m (7.9–14.1 ft) long and weighs between 700–1,000 kg (1,500–2,200 lb),[8][9] but has been recorded at up to 7.3 m (24 ft) and more than 1,400 kg (3,100 lb).[10][11] Most Greenland sharks observed have been around 2.4–4.8 m (8–16 ft) long and weigh up to 400 kg (880 lb).[10][11]

        Males are typically smaller than females. It rivals the Pacific sleeper shark (possibly up to 7 m or 23 ft long) as the largest species in the family Somniosidae. The Greenland shark is a thickset species, with a short, rounded snout, small eyes, and very small dorsal and pectoral fins. The gill openings are very small for the species' great size.
        
        Coloration can range from pale creamy-gray to blackish-brown and the body is typically uniform in color, though whitish spots or faint dark streaks are occasionally seen on the back.[10]</p>

    <p class="p2"><b>NAME:</b>Whale<br><br><b>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</b>Cetacea<br><br><b>ORIGIN:</b>Asia and Antarctica<br><br><b>LIFESPAN:</b>85 to 90 Years</p>
    <p class="p3">The bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) is a species of baleen whale belonging to the family Balaenidae and the only living representative of the genus Balaena. They are the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and subarctic waters, and are named after their characteristic massive triangular skull, which they use to break through Arctic ice. Other common names of the species are the Greenland right whale or Arctic whale. </p>
    <p class="p4">Bowheads have the largest mouth of any animal[6] representing almost one-third of the length of the body, the longest baleen plates with a maximum length of 4 metres (13 feet)[7] and may be the longest-lived mammals, with the ability to reach an age of more than 200 years.[8]

        The bowhead was an early whaling target. Their population was severely reduced before a 1966 moratorium was passed to protect the species. Of the five stocks of bowhead populations, three are listed as "endangered", one as "vulnerable", and one as "lower risk, conservation dependent" according to the IUCN Red List. The global population is assessed as of least concern.[3][9]</p>
    <p class="p5">Today, the bowhead whale occupies a monotypic genus, separate from the right whales, as proposed by the work of John Edward Gray in 1821.[11] For the next 180 years, the family Balaenidae was the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. Eventually, it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were different, but there was still no strong consensus as to whether they shared a single genus or two. As recently as 1998, Dale Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification, Marine Mammals of the World: Systematics and Distribution, listed just two species: B. glacialis (the right whales) and B. mysticetus (the bowheads).[12]

        Studies in the 2000s finally provided clear evidence that the three living right whale species comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and that the bowhead and the right whales are rightly classified into two separate genera.[13] The right whales were thus confirmed to be in a separate genus, Eubalaena. The relationship is shown in the cladogram below:</p>
