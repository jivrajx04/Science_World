    <p class="p2"><b>NAME:</b>Monitor Lizard<br><br><b>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</b>Varanus<br><br><b>ORIGIN:</b>Asia and Africa<br><br><b>LIFESPAN:</b>20 to 30 Years</p>
    <p class="p3">Monitor lizards are lizards in the genus Varanus, the only extant genus in the family Varanidae. They are native to Africa, Asia, and Oceania, and one species is also found in the Americas as an invasive species. About 80 species are recognized.</p>
    <p class="p4">Monitor lizards have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. The adult length of extant species ranges from 20 cm (7.9 in) in some species, to over 3 m (10 ft) in the case of the Komodo dragon, though the extinct varanid known as megalania (Varanus priscus) may have been capable of reaching lengths more than 7 m (23 ft).</p>
    <p class="p5">Monitor lizards have a high aerobic scope[13][14] that is afforded, in part, by their heart anatomy. Whereas most reptiles are considered to have three-chambered hearts, the hearts of monitor lizards – as with those of boas and pythons – have a well developed ventricular septum that completely separates the pulmonary and systemic sides of the circulatory system during systole.[15] This allows monitor lizards to create mammalian-equivalent pressure differentials between the pulmonary and systemic circuits,[15] which in turn ensure that oxygenated blood is quickly distributed to the body without also flooding the lungs with high-pressure blood.</p>

    <p class="p2"><b>NAME:</b>King Cobra<br><br><b>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</b>Ophiophagus hannah<br><br><b>ORIGIN:</b>India<br><br><b>LIFESPAN:</b>20 to 30 Years</p>
    <p class="p3">The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is a species of venomous elapid snake endemic to jungles in Southern and Southeast Asia. The sole member of the genus Ophiophagus, it is distinguishable from other cobras, most noticeably by its size and neck patterns. </p>
         <p class="p4"> The king cobra is the world's longest venomous snake, with an average length of 3.18 to 4 m (10.4 to 13.1 ft),[2] reaching a maximum of 5.85 m (19.2 ft).[3] Its skin colour varies across the habitats, from black with white stripes to unbroken brownish grey. It preys chiefly on other snakes, including its own species. Unlike other snakes, it rarely hunts other vertebrates, such as rodents and lizards.</p>
    <p class="p5">Like most cobras and mambas, the king cobra's threat display includes spreading its neck-flap, raising its head upright, puffing, and hissing. Despite its fearsome reputation, the king cobra avoids confrontation with humans whenever possible. When provoked, however, it is capable of striking a target at long range and well above the ground. Rather than biting and retreating, it may sustain its bite and inject a large quantity of venom, which is a medical emergency.[4][5]</p>

    <p class="p3">Craspedocephalus gramineus, known as the bamboo pit viper, Indian green pit viper, or common green pit viper,[3] is a venomous pit viper species found in the southern and north eastern parts of India. No subspecies are currently recognized.</p>
    <p class="p4">The upper parts are usually bright green, rarely yellowish, greyish, or purplish brown, with or without black, brown, or reddish spots; usually a light, white, yellow, or red streak along the outer row of scales; end of tail frequently yellow or red; lower parts green, yellow, or whitish.[4]</p>
    <p class="p5">The rostral scale is as deep as broad or broader than deep. The upper head-scales are small, smooth, imbricate; supraocular scale narrow, rarely broken up. The internasals are contact or separated by one or two scales. There are 8 to 13 scales on a line between the supraoculars; usually one or two, rarely three, series of scales between the suboculars and the labials; 9 to 12 upper labials, second usually forming the anterior border of the loreal pit, third largest; temporal scales smooth. The dorsal scales are more or less distinctly keeled, in 21 (rarely 19 or 23) rows; ventrals 145–175; anal scale entire; subcaudals in two rows 53–76.</p>

    <p class="p2"><b>NAME:</b>Lizard<br><br><b>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</b>Hemidactylus frenatus<br><br><b>ORIGIN:</b>Asia and Africa<br><br><b>LIFESPAN:</b>5 to 6 Years</p>
    <p class="p3">The common house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) is a gecko native to South and Southeast Asia. It is also known as the Asian house gecko, Pacific house gecko, wall gecko, house lizard, tayoto, chipkali[3] or moon lizard.</p>
    <p class="p4">They grow to a length of between 7.5–15 cm (3–6 in), and live for about 7 years. These small geckos are non-venomous and not harmful to humans. Most medium-sized to large geckos are docile, but may bite if distressed, which can pierce skin. The common house gecko is tropical, and thrives in warm, humid areas where it can crawl around on rotting wood in search of the insects it eats, as well as within urban landscapes in warm climates. </p>
    <p class="p5">The common house gecko is by no means a misnomer, displaying a clear preference for urban environments. The synanthropic gecko displays a tendency to hunt for insects in close proximity to urban lights.[5] They have been found in bushland, but the current evidence seems to suggest they have a preference for urban environments, with their distribution being mostly defined by areas within or in close proximity to city bounds.[6][failed verification]</p>
